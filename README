# Introduction
Module elmpy is a python based module intended for a project involving the elimination of astronomical trails left by earth orbiting satellites. The code is going to be able to scan astronomical images and automatically detect and filter these trails. It does this by utilizing a variation of the hough transform and robust elimination.

# Running the Code
Before running the code it is necessary to download sample images through the link below:
https://github.com/downloads/gregorylemberskiy/Elimination-of-Lines/Sample_gz_Files.tar.gz

It is necessary to provide a fits.gz file which will be scanned for astronomical trails. If a file is not provided, the program will search for the default fits.gz file "NGC_3521_UGC_6150-r.fits.gz", which can be found in the tar file. 
To run default file:
python __init__.py

To run other file: 
python __init__.py --f "Other_File.fits.gz"

# Issues!
The code has an issue with optimization over the 7 parameter Model {Offset, Angle, Sky, Thickness, Normalization, left endpoint, right endpoint}. However, the code does not have a problem optimizing over a simpler model as shown in endpoint_fit.py. The endpoint problem must be resolved in Optim.py before successfully eliminating astronomical trails.
